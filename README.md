# Woodcutter
Datapack for Minecraft that allows crafting of wood products at the Stonecutter in a similar fashion to stone products.

All recipes are generated from templates by `generate_json.py`.

The Stonecutter does not support recipes consuming more than of the input item ([bug?](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-151141)), so some recipes such as doors are cheaper than they should be.
